# Gobots - Go version on Crobots

Way back when I was a programming student in 1988, I ran across a game called [crobots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crobots) by Tom Poindexter.  It was a neat little game where you wrote a program for a virtual robot and battled against another robot in an arena.  Each robot's code ran on a virtual CPU running a subset of the C language.  Basic functions were provided for reading inputs, commanding the robot, and trigometry.  I had fun playing for a while.  When I decided to learn the Go Programming language, I was looking for a func program to implement.  I also wanted to explore Docker containers and gRPC.  Rather than implement a virtual CPU, I will allow the robot code to be written in straight Go, proving a gRPC interface to commaand the robot running in an arena server. I'm prototyping the API to the robot from another implementation of Crobots called [netrobots](https://github.com/bonzini/netrobots), which did something similar to what I am attempting, only in the C++ language.
